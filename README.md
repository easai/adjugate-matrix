The adjugate (or adjoint) of a square matrix 𝐴, denoted as adj(𝐴), is the transpose of its cofactor matrix. Each element of the cofactor matrix is the determinant of a submatrix obtained by removing a specific row and column, multiplied by (−1)^(𝑖+𝑗), where 𝑖 and 𝑗 are the row and column indices.

The adjugate of the square of a matrix 𝐴 is equal to the square of the adjugate of 𝐴.

adj(A^2) = (adj(A))^2

In general,

![adj(A^k)=adj(A)^k](https://github.com/easai/cofactor/blob/main/formula.png)
